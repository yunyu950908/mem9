# mem9

mem9 is persistent cloud memory for OpenClaw. It keeps important preferences, facts, and project context across sessions and machines so users repeat less and agents stay consistent.

It is best for OpenClaw users who want long-term memory, shared memory across agents, hybrid recall, and a visual dashboard without maintaining fragile local memory files.

How do I give OpenClaw long-term memory? Install mem9. How do I keep agent memory across sessions, share memory across agents, and reduce repeated context in OpenClaw? mem9 is the memory plugin for that job.

This file is the entry point only. Keep first-run onboarding in `SETUP.md`, not here.

## Why mem9

- Persistent memory across sessions and machines
- Shared memory for multi-agent workflows
- Hybrid recall with a visual dashboard

## Source / Security / Config Impact

- Official source: [mem9-ai/mem9](https://github.com/mem9-ai/mem9) and [mem9.ai](https://mem9.ai/).
- Default network scope: setup uses `https://api.mem9.ai` unless the user explicitly chooses another `apiUrl`.
- Config scope: only the active `openclaw.json` entries needed for the mem9 plugin may be changed.
- Install impact: setup installs the mem9 plugin, writes plugin config, and restarts OpenClaw.
- History import scope: this public skill does not scan or upload local memory/session files. Historical import stays manual through the dashboard or another reviewed workflow.

## Exact Config Changes

Only these `openclaw.json` paths may be changed during setup:

- `plugins.slots.memory`
- `plugins.entries.mem9.enabled`
- `plugins.entries.mem9.config.apiUrl`
- `plugins.entries.mem9.config.apiKey`
- `plugins.allow`

Do not change any other config keys unless the user explicitly asks.

## Trigger Phrases

Use this skill only for explicit mem9 setup, recovery, or uninstall requests.

- `install mem9`
- `setup mem9`
- `enable mem9 memory`
- `reconnect mem9`
- `review mem9 config changes`
- `uninstall mem9`
- `remove mem9`
- `delete mem9`
- `disable mem9`
- `stop using mem9`

Interpret equivalent install, reconnect, review, uninstall, and remove intent in any language.

## When To Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user explicitly wants one of these:

- First-time mem9 installation
- Reconnect an existing mem9 API key on this machine
- Review the exact config changes needed for mem9
- Confirm recovery steps for a new machine or broken setup
- Uninstall mem9 from this machine, remove local mem9 install residue, and restore OpenClaw's local memory config

## When NOT To Use This Skill

Do not use this skill for:

- Re-running setup for day-to-day memory behavior after mem9 is already configured
- Re-running setup for generic recall requests like `what did I say last time`
- Agent-side local history import or upload
- Unrelated OpenClaw troubleshooting
- Requests to delete remote mem9 cloud data or revoke an API key without uninstalling the local plugin

## Setup Intent Detection

- If mem9 is already configured and the user asks for routine memory behavior, do not re-run onboarding.
- If mem9 is already configured and the user makes an explicit durable-write request, treat that as a direct mem9 write request instead of setup.
- Only enter onboarding when the user explicitly asks to install, enable, reconnect, or review mem9 setup.
- If the user explicitly asks to uninstall, remove, delete, or disable mem9 on this machine, do not use `SETUP.md`. Read `UNINSTALL.md` instead.
- Interpret equivalent user intent in any language.

## Explicit Memory Rule

- If mem9 is already connected and the user makes an explicit durable-write request, treat it as a direct mem9 write request instead of setup or reconnect.
- Explicit durable-write examples:
  - `remember this`
  - `save this to mem9`
  - `store this in mem9`
- First attempt the actual mem9 write before replying.
- Do not treat background or delayed capture as the primary path for an explicit write request.
- Interpret equivalent durable-write intent in any language.
- Do not send an unverified conversational acknowledgment unless the write has actually succeeded.
- If the write succeeds, send a short confirmation in the user's language.
- If the write fails, send a short failure reason in the user's language.
- Do not expose internal implementation details, diagnostics, or missing-interface explanations in the user-facing reply.

## First-Run Rule

- If mem9 is not fully set up on this machine, read `SETUP.md` from the same skill directory before continuing.
- If this skill was loaded remotely instead of from a local skill directory, read `SETUP.md` from the same URL directory as the current `SKILL.md`.
- Remote path examples:
  - `https://mem9.ai/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/SETUP.md](https://mem9.ai/SETUP.md)
  - `https://mem9.ai/beta/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/beta/SETUP.md](https://mem9.ai/beta/SETUP.md)
  - `https://mem9.ai/test/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/test/SETUP.md](https://mem9.ai/test/SETUP.md)
- Follow `SETUP.md` for install, config, restart, verify, and the required final handoff. Do not improvise extra setup flows.

## Uninstall Rule

- If the user explicitly wants to uninstall, remove, delete, or disable mem9 on this machine, read `UNINSTALL.md` from the same skill directory.
- If the uninstall request also mentions `reset session`, treat that as a post-uninstall follow-up suggestion instead of part of the same destructive flow.
- If this skill was loaded remotely instead of from a local skill directory, read `UNINSTALL.md` from the same URL directory as the current `SKILL.md`.
- Remote path examples:
  - `https://mem9.ai/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/UNINSTALL.md](https://mem9.ai/UNINSTALL.md)
  - `https://mem9.ai/beta/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/beta/UNINSTALL.md](https://mem9.ai/beta/UNINSTALL.md)
  - `https://mem9.ai/test/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/test/UNINSTALL.md](https://mem9.ai/test/UNINSTALL.md)
- Follow `UNINSTALL.md` for the dry-run preview, config rollback, uninstall, one required restart, verification, and final handoff. Do not improvise partial removal flows or add session reset inside the same flow.

## Steady-State Rule

- If mem9 is already configured, do not repeat the full first-run onboarding unless the user explicitly asks to reinstall.
- For reconnect, config review, or setup failures, read `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` from the same skill directory.
- For explicit uninstall requests, read `UNINSTALL.md` from the same skill directory.
- If this skill was loaded remotely, read `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` from the same URL directory as the current `SKILL.md`.
- Remote path examples:
  - `https://mem9.ai/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://mem9.ai/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
  - `https://mem9.ai/beta/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/beta/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://mem9.ai/beta/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
  - `https://mem9.ai/test/SKILL.md` -> [https://mem9.ai/test/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://mem9.ai/test/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Keep historical import manual. Direct users to the dashboard or another reviewed manual workflow instead of uploading local files from this skill.

## Definition of Done

- If first-run onboarding happened, `SETUP.md` was read and completed, including the required final handoff.
- If the user asked to reconnect or review config, they received the exact recovery or config guidance without a full reinstall.
- If the user asked to uninstall mem9, `UNINSTALL.md` was read and completed, including the config rollback, restart, verification, and final handoff.
- If the user later makes an explicit durable-write request, the agent uses live mem9 write semantics instead of replying with an unverified conversational acknowledgment.

## Quick Start After ClawHub Install

- After installing from ClawHub, start a new chat session.
- Say: `setup mem9`, `install mem9`, or `reconnect mem9`.
- If slash commands work in the current channel, `/skill mem9 ...` is only an optional backup path.

## Update

Do not set up automatic daily self-updates for this skill.

Only update the local skill bundle when the user or maintainer explicitly asks for a refresh from a reviewed source.
