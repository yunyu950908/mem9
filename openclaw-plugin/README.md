# OpenClaw Plugin for mem9

Memory plugin for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) — replaces the built-in memory slot with cloud-persistent shared memory. Runs in server mode only, connecting to `mnemo-server` via `apiUrl` + `apiKey` (preferred) or legacy `tenantID`. Optional `provisionQueryParams` can forward `utm_*` attribution only during first-time auto-provisioning.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Server Mode)

**You need a running `mnemo-server` instance.**

```bash
# 1. Start the server
cd mnemos/server
MNEMO_DSN="user:pass@tcp(host:4000)/mnemos?parseTime=true" go run ./cmd/mnemo-server

# 2. Provision a tenant
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha1/mem9s \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"openclaw-tenant"}'

# Response:
# {"id": "uuid"}
```

Add mem9 to your project's `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": { "memory": "mem9" },
    "entries": {
      "mem9": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
          "apiKey": "uuid",
          "searchTimeoutMs": 15000
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**That's it!** Restart OpenClaw and your agent now has persistent cloud memory.

The plugin always uses `/v1alpha2/mem9s/memories/...` with `X-API-Key: <key>`. Legacy `tenantID` config is still supported as an alias for `apiKey`.

## How It Works

```
OpenClaw loads plugin as kind: "memory"
     ↓
Plugin replaces built-in memory slot → framework manages lifecycle
     ↓
5 tools registered: store / search / get / update / delete
     ↓
4 lifecycle hooks: auto-recall, auto-capture, compact/reset awareness
```

This is a `kind: "memory"` plugin — OpenClaw's framework manages when to load/save memories. The plugin provides 5 tools **plus** 4 lifecycle hooks for automatic memory management:

### Lifecycle Hooks (Automatic)

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `before_prompt_build` | Every LLM call | Searches memories by current prompt and injects relevant ones as context |
| `after_compaction` | After `/compact` | Logs compaction so the next prompt re-queries memories from the server |
| `before_reset` | Before `/reset` | Saves a session summary (last 3 user messages) as memory before context is wiped |
| `agent_end` | Agent finishes | Auto-captures the last assistant response as memory (if substantial) |

### Tools (Agent-Invoked)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `memory_store` | Store a new memory |
| `memory_search` | Hybrid vector + keyword search (or keyword-only) |
| `memory_get` | Retrieve a single memory by ID |
| `memory_update` | Update an existing memory |
| `memory_delete` | Delete a memory by ID |

**Key improvement**: After `/compact` or `/reset`, the agent no longer "forgets" — lifecycle hooks ensure memories are automatically re-injected into the LLM context on the very next prompt.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) installed (`>=2026.1.26`)
- A running [mnemo-server](../server/) instance

## Installation

### Method A: npm install (Recommended)

```bash
openclaw plugins install @mem9/mem9
```

### Method B: From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mem9-ai/mem9.git
cd mem9/openclaw-plugin
npm install
```

### Configure OpenClaw

Add mem9 to your project's `openclaw.json`:

OpenClaw is often deployed across teams with multiple agents. Server mode gives you:

- **Space isolation** — each team/project gets its own memory pool, no cross-contamination
- **Per-agent identity** — every OpenClaw instance can pass its own `X-Mnemo-Agent-Id` header
- **Centralized management** — one mnemo-server manages all memory, with rate limiting and access controls
- **LLM conflict merge (Phase 2)** — when two agents write to the same key, the server can merge intelligently

**Step 1: Deploy mnemo-server**

```bash
cd mnemos/server
MNEMO_DSN="user:pass@tcp(tidb-host:4000)/mnemos?parseTime=true" go run ./cmd/mnemo-server
```

**Step 2: Provision a tenant**

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1alpha1/mem9s \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"openclaw-tenant"}'

# Response:
# {"id": "uuid"}
```

**Step 3: Configure each OpenClaw instance**

Each agent uses the same `apiKey` for the shared memory pool. The plugin sends that value in `X-API-Key` and never places it in the URL path. Legacy `tenantID` config still works as an alias for the same value.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "memory": "mem9"
    },
    "entries": {
      "mem9": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiUrl": "http://your-server:8080",
          "apiKey": "uuid"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. The server handles scoping and conflict resolution. Conceptually, the only required values are `apiUrl` + `apiKey`.

### Verify

Start OpenClaw. You should see:

```text
[mem9] Server mode (v1alpha2)
```

If you see `[mem9] No mode configured...`, check your `openclaw.json` config.

## Config Schema

Defined in `openclaw.plugin.json`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `apiUrl` | string | mnemo-server URL |
| `apiKey` | string | Preferred key. Uses `/v1alpha2/mem9s/...` with `X-API-Key` header |
| `provisionQueryParams` | object | Optional `utm_*` map forwarded only to the initial `POST /v1alpha1/mem9s` auto-provision request when `apiKey` is absent |
| `defaultTimeoutMs` | number | Default timeout for non-search mem9 API requests in milliseconds. Default: `8000` |
| `searchTimeoutMs` | number | Timeout for `memory_search` and automatic recall search in milliseconds. Default: `15000` |
| `tenantID` | string | Legacy alias for `apiKey`. The plugin still uses `/v1alpha2/mem9s/...` with `X-API-Key`. |

> **Note**: `apiKey` takes precedence when both fields are set. If only `tenantID` is present, the plugin treats it as a legacy alias for `apiKey`, still uses v1alpha2, and logs a deprecation warning once at startup. `provisionQueryParams` is ignored after an `apiKey` is already configured, and non-`utm_*` keys are dropped before the provision request is sent.

## Timeout Behavior

The plugin uses two timeout buckets:

- `searchTimeoutMs` applies to `memory_search` and the automatic recall search in `before_prompt_build`
- `defaultTimeoutMs` applies to all other mem9 HTTP requests, including register, store, get, update, delete, and ingest

Example:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiUrl": "http://your-server:8080",
          "apiKey": "uuid",
          "defaultTimeoutMs": 8000,
          "searchTimeoutMs": 15000
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `No mode configured` | Missing config | Add `apiUrl` and `apiKey` (or legacy `tenantID`) to plugin config |
| `Server mode requires...` | Missing key | Add `apiKey` (or legacy `tenantID`) to config |
| Search requests time out | Hybrid/vector search exceeds plugin timeout | Increase `searchTimeoutMs` in plugin config |
| Plugin not loading | Not in memory slot | Set `"slots": {"memory": "mem9"}` in openclaw.json |
